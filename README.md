# React Book Club
This is a fullstack (PERN) book club/ forum where users can sign up, and create books/topics to discuss with other users.
There is Moderator functionality, where users that are marked as mods can review posts that have been flagged, and choose to delete or un-flag based on their own criteria.

## Project Overview
This is an initial version of the project that I have had on a to-do list for when I got around to learning how to make websites. Eventually, I would like to incorporate a component where physical books can be passed around and their locations can be tracked within the website.
As it is, the scope fits the goals of a current assignment I have.

## Installation
This can be cloned from this Git repository and run locally, or deployed. I would ask that a link back to this project be included in any deployed capacities.

## Contact Info
I can be reached at travisjslagle@gmail.com if there are further questions or issues.

## Known Bugs


## Changelog
2020.09.09: v1.0 -- Initial deployment with all basic functionalities included.
